# Important announcement about the app

My development environment was infected by unknown malicious software, as a result of which a few builds may have been affected. Once the issue was detected, I secured everything with a full disk wipe, restored a clean setup, and now all builds are scanned with VirusTotal. The F-Droid version will also be verified before release.

Public keys may have been compromised, which is why I am sharing this issue. You can download the new version and the new public key below, and instructions for restoring backups are provided.

No extra actions are required since the app uses **one-time connection codes**. These codes have very limited permissions (for example, they cannot change your password). Still, you can revoke them if you want full peace of mind.

# How to revoke access:

1. Open [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Find **“Your connections to third-party apps & services”**
3. Tap **“See all connection”** and locate **YouTube TV** or **Google Drive**
4. Select the app → **“Remove access”**

Please keep built-in security features enabled to stay protected.
